Cloak
=====

If you would like to join in on the fun, feel free to contact hello@rdevmobile.com we are always looking for more devs.

Cloak is an Android app that uses Behavioral Analysis to register frequented user actions. Cloak can then differentiate between you and another user on your phone. Cloak is better than a passcode and is the Ultimate Security Tool for Android Devices. Cloak is still in a very early stage of development and although some features are currently working we do not recommend relying on Cloak as your sole security.
